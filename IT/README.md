# IT_Lab
This repository holds all the code samples for the Internet Technology Lab that I attended in College. This is basically a walk-through in basics of ASP.NET development using C# and SQL. There are applications of ADO.NET Frameworks, Skin files for Visual Studios 2019 etc.

The sample codes in around here might help you to brush up your ASP.NET/C# basics.
